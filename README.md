## A list of possible PHP job interview questions regarding string manipulation

**Question 1: Reverse a String**
Write a PHP function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string. For example, if the input is "hello", the function should return "olleh".

**Question 2: Count Vowels**
Write a PHP function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in that string. For example, if the input is "apple", the function should return 2.

**Question 3: Palindrome Check**
Write a PHP function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The function should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

**Question 4: Capitalize Words**
Write a PHP function that takes a sentence as input and returns the same sentence with each word capitalized. For example, if the input is "hello world", the function should return "Hello World".

**Question 5: Remove Duplicate Characters**
Write a PHP function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all duplicate characters removed. For example, if the input is "programming", the function should return "progamin".

**Question 6: Replace Substring**
Write a PHP function that takes three parameters: a source string, a substring to search for, and a replacement string. The function should replace all occurrences of the substring in the source string with the replacement string.

**Question 7: String Compression**
Write a PHP function that performs basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string is not shorter than the original string, the function should return the original string.

**Question 8: Anagram Check**
Write a PHP function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another. The function should return true if the strings are anagrams and false otherwise.

**Question 9: Word Frequency**
Write a PHP function that takes a paragraph of text as input and returns an associative array where keys are unique words in the paragraph, and values are the frequencies of those words.

**Question 10: Truncate String**
Write a PHP function that takes a string and a maximum length as input and truncates the string to the specified maximum length while appending "..." at the end to indicate truncation. If the string is already shorter than the maximum length, it should be returned as is.
